# User Story for Issue #142: Add CODEOWNERS file

## User Story

**As a** repository maintainer,  
**I want to** add a CODEOWNERS file to the setup-cli repository,  
**So that** code reviews are automatically assigned to the appropriate team members and code ownership is clearly defined.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given-When-Then Format:

1. **Given** the repository lacks a CODEOWNERS file,  
   **When** a CODEOWNERS file is added to the root directory,  
   **Then** the file should be present and properly formatted.

2. **Given** a CODEOWNERS file exists in the repository,  
   **When** a pull request is created that modifies files,  
   **Then** the appropriate code owners should be automatically assigned as reviewers.

3. **Given** the CODEOWNERS file specifies ownership rules,  
   **When** team members view the file,  
   **Then** they should clearly understand who owns which parts of the codebase.

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] A `CODEOWNERS` file is present in the root directory of the repository
- [ ] The CODEOWNERS file follows GitHub's standard format and syntax
- [ ] The file specifies appropriate owners for relevant directories and files
- [ ] Code ownership rules are clearly defined for critical components
- [ ] Pull requests automatically assign reviewers based on the CODEOWNERS file
- [ ] The functionality is verified by creating a test pull request
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reference the new CODEOWNERS file (if applicable)

## Definition of Done

- CODEOWNERS file is created and committed to the main branch
- File syntax is validated and working correctly
- Automatic reviewer assignment is tested and functioning
- Team members are informed about the new code ownership process

## Priority

**Medium** - Improves development workflow and code review process

## Estimated Effort

**Small** - 1-2 story points (simple file creation and configuration)
